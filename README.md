The Hopfield Neural Networks, invented by Dr John J. Hopfield consists of one layer of ‘n’ fully connected recurrent neurons. It is generally used in performing auto-association and optimization tasks. It is calculated using a converging interactive process and it generates a different response than our normal neural nets.
